## Introduction

This is a note about my learning process about deep learning and MRI reconstruction.

## Deep Learning

#### 1 [Deep Learning tutial](https://github.com/sjchoi86/dl_tutorials) 

These are introdution slides about CNN and RNN including some basic applications and python code. 

## MRI Related

#### 1 [Deepmedic](https://github.com/Kamnitsask/deepmedic)

These is a project about brain segmentation including code,data and a nice tutorial.
