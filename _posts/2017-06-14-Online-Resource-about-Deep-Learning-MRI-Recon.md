## Introduction

This is a note about my learning process about deep learning and MRI reconstruction.

## Deep Learning

#### 1 [Deep Learning tutial](https://github.com/sjchoi86/dl_tutorials) 

These are introdution slides about CNN and RNN including some basic applications and python code. 

#### [莫烦python](https://morvanzhou.github.io/tutorials/)

#### [Theano学习笔记](http://www.cnblogs.com/hanahimi/p/4127026.html)

#### [机器之心：从零开始掌握Python机器学习（附资源）]（https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/6b42088a-3f36-4a57-b060-4a362993dea4）
